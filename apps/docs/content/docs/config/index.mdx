description: How to configure Config in Next MW?
---

In Next MW, you have two ways to define when your middleware should run. You can either use the traditional Next.js approach with the `matcher` property or take advantage of a new, more explicit and intuitive configuration using the **include** and **exclude** properties.

## Two Configuration Approaches

### 1. Using `matcher`

The traditional approach is to use a single `matcher` property to define which routes the middleware applies to. This method leverages Next.js' built-in route matching logic.

**Example:**
```typescript
export const config = {
  matcher: '/about/:path*',
} satisfies Config;
```

### 2. Using `include` and `exclude`

The new approach allows you to specify two separate properties:
- **include**: Defines the routes on which the middleware should be executed.
- **exclude**: Defines the routes that should be skipped.

This approach is simpler and more intuitive. It makes your configuration more declarative and easier to understand.

**Example:**
```typescript
export const config = {
  include: ['/dashboard/:path*', '/profile/:path*'],
  exclude: ['/dashboard/admin/:path*', '/api/:path*'],
} satisfies Config;
```

In this configuration:
- The middleware will run on requests matching `/dashboard/:path*` or `/profile/:path*`.
- The middleware will be skipped for requests matching `/dashboard/admin/:path*` or `/api/:path*`.

## TypeScript

The configuration is strongly typed to ensure that you can either use the `matcher` property or the `include`/`exclude` properties, but not both at the same time. Here are the relevant types:

```typescript
config?: Config;
```

### Types

#### Config

```typescript
type Config = ConfigMatcher | ConfigIncludeExclude;
```

#### ConfigMatcher

```typescript
type ConfigMatcher = {
  matcher: Matcher;
  include?: never;
  exclude?: never;
};
```

#### ConfigIncludeExclude

```typescript
type ConfigIncludeExclude = {
  matcher?: never;
  include?: Matcher;
  exclude?: Matcher;
};
```
