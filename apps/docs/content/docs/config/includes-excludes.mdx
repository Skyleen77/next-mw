import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

We have decided to add a new way to configure middleware matching by using the **include** and **exclude** properties. This approach is simpler and more intuitive than using a single complex `matcher` property.

## Usage

<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">
  You cannot use `include` and `exclude` in the `middleware.ts` file. This syntax is specific to Next MW, and Next.js does not understand it.
</Callout>

Instead of using a single `matcher` property, you can define two separate properties: **include** and **exclude**.

- **include**: Specifies the routes on which the middleware should be executed.
- **exclude**: Specifies the routes that should be skipped.

For example, if you want your middleware to run on dashboard and profile routes but not on admin or API routes you can define your configuration like this:

```typescript
export const config = {
  include: ['/dashboard/:path*', '/profile/:path*'],
  exclude: ['/dashboard/admin/:path*', '/api/:path*'],
} satisfies Config;
```

In this configuration:
- The middleware is executed for requests matching `/dashboard/:path*` or `/profile/:path*`.
- The middleware is skipped if the request also matches `/dashboard/admin/:path*` or `/api/:path*`.

<Callout type="warn" title="Warning">
  When using `include` and `exclude`, do not combine them with the `matcher` property. If both are defined, a runtime error will be thrown.
</Callout>

## TypeScript

The `include` and `exclude` properties use the same type as `matcher`. This means you can use a simple string, a complex matcher object, or an array of these.

```typescript
config?: { 
  include?: Matcher;
  exclude?: Matcher;
};
```

### Types

#### Matcher

```typescript
type Matcher = string | MatcherCondition | (string | MatcherCondition)[];
```

#### MatcherObject

```typescript
interface MatcherCondition {
  source: string;
  regexp?: string;
  locale?: boolean;
  has?: MatcherElement[];
  missing?: MatcherElement[];
}
```

#### MatcherElement

```typescript
type MatcherElement =
  | { type: AllowedMatcherType; key: string; value?: string }
  | { type: string; key: string; value?: string };
```

#### AllowedMatcherType

```typescript
type AllowedMatcherType = 'header' | 'query' | 'cookie';
```
