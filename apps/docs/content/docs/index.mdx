## Next MW â€“ A Better Middleware Management for Next.js

Next.js offers a **simple and efficient middleware system**. However, it has a **major limitation**: there is only **one `middleware.ts` file** for the entire application.

### The Problem: Only One Global Middleware

In Next.js, the `middleware.ts` file **can only contain a single middleware**, leading to several issues:
- **You can't have multiple independent middlewares:** all logic must be merged into a single function.
- **Increasing complexity:** adding features (auth, logs, rate-limiting, etc.) forces everything into one file, making maintenance difficult.
- **Incompatibility with some libraries:** integrating multiple external middlewares is challenging since they must be manually combined.

### Easily Compose Multiple Middlewares

**Next MW** solves this issue by allowing you to **compose multiple independent middlewares** and execute them sequentially, while keeping full compatibility with Next.js' native middleware system.

Unlike Next.js, which forces you to use a **single global middleware**, **Next MW** lets you define **multiple middlewares separately**, each with its own matcher to target specific routes.

### How Does It Work?

With Next MW, you can structure your code like this:
 
<Files>
  <Folder name="middlewares" defaultOpen>
    <File name="auth-middleware.ts" />
    <File name="admin-middleware.ts" />
    <File name="rate-limit-middleware.ts" />
  </Folder>
  <File name="middleware.ts" />
</Files>

Then, you **compose them** in `middleware.ts` and execute them sequentially. Each middleware remains **independent**, with its own configuration and logic.

### Why Use Next MW?

âœ… **Total modularity** â€“ No more bloated `middleware.ts`; each middleware is independent.

âœ… **Fully compatible with Next.js** â€“ Uses the native Next.js middleware system and matchers.

âœ… **Sequential execution** â€“ Middlewares run in order and stop as soon as one returns a response.

âœ… **Easy integration** â€“ Allows you to use multiple middlewares, including third-party ones, without complex hacks.

âœ… **TypeScript support** â€“ Written in TypeScript with proper type definitions.

âœ… **Compatible with App and Pages directory** â€“ Works with both the `app` and `pages` directories.

**ðŸš€ With Next MW, manage your middlewares in a clear, modular, and scalable way in Next.js!**
